# [What is OpenTelemetry?](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/)

A short explanation of what OpenTelemetry is and isnâ€™t.

- OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel, is a vendor-neutral open source Observability framework for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs.
- Not an observability backend like Jaeger, Prometheus, or other commercial vendors.
